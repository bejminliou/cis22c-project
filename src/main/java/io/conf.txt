Your project must read from a file that contains at least 15 full Users,
including each User's friends and interests.
There must be at least two Users with duplicate name contained within this file,
and you must demonstrate that your program
handles searching for Users with this duplicate name
as part of your project demonstration.
The file must contain all 15 Users and be structured like this:

id
name
username
password
total number of friends
list of ids of all friends on separate lines
city
total number of interests
list of interests, each on a separate line 

Note that each User should have a minimum of 3 friends when the program begins.
